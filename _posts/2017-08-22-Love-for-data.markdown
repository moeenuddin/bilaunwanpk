Hi, Here i am

I have thought a lot, and actually did nothing, and finally came up with this site. ‘Love for data’ is the first post title I chose and I want to post more on it. The good thing is that there is so much data (related and unrelated) that we are going to have fun while talking about it.

‘Machine learning’, yes, I want to learn it, but i would be covering very basic of it. The basic which apparently do not matters, but when everything goes messy, it matters. I will try to learn bayses theorem and show where it works, where it not.
 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
