 Who is your spiritual councilor. 
 
 And you are getting married to such a person who heals you day after day, and is ready to understand you when you need it.
 
 Ye baat serious hai, laikin, aisa hona nahi chahiye.
 
 
 There is a clear difference between married and bachelor life. But getting married twice and thrice is like the brave thing
 a person can do in his life. I believe such a person has a lot of flexibility in thinking. and the relationship needs to be learnt
 from this person.
