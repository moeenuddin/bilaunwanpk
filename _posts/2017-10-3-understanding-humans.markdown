Ever since the first man came into existence, human's inquisitive nature is the most prominent natural characteristic.

Understanding human is important an core to society now. Human life is more valuable than before. and this significance
will keep increasing with time. This is my attempt to understand human in the simplest possible way. A 
series of articles that can help you build perspective about some things.

1. The way we think!

I am going to think in terms of outcome. The most practical way to realize the reality.
The way we think is the core. The way we think is made up of the things we experience and 
the experiences can lead to stimulate human brain to reason out them.


We are pleased to start this web site, and we will try to put more effort to make it better. As it looks, we like simple designs, and more work / skill variety to show off.
