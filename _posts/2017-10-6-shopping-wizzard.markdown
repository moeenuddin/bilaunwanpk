Wizzard, a person who can do a trick to show a tremendous work done in very easy way.

A shopping cart that does the similar attempt is here.

	you go to a market, take a cart because you know that you want to spend time
	in the shop, looking around for things that you need, or may want, or you 
	specifically want to have for now. It will help you carry the product. It will
	be disposable, and not your owner-ship, and it will make you just do your task.
	and you are gone.
